**'Jørgens Hede Hule' is a series of commercials (sketches) for the Danish snack manufacturer KiMs. Their well-known 'CEO' Jørgen is about to retire and has arranged an audition to find his replacement.**
    
This is a project I did with [Christopher Leo](https://twitter.com/chris2pherleo) for [Wibroe, Duckert & Partners](https://www.wdp.dk/). On set, Cristopher and I were in charge of filming, sound recording and lighting and in post production Cristopher did the editing.
