**Pick-and-place technology (PNP) is centered around the goal of autonomously placing electrical components on a printed circuit boards (PCB) with high precision and speed. But the technology is quite expensive and thus many students and maker-spaces has no access to it. To combat this [Jonas Attrup](https://github.com/Attrup), [Mikkel Berrig](https://github.com/mikkelBerrig) and I set out construct a more affordable solution by turning an old 3D printer into a fully functional PNP Machine.**
