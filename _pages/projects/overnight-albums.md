**Is it possible to write and record an entire album during one single night?**

A group of friends and I have taken on this challenge twice so far, and as one would expect the results are very unique to say the least. To make things even more challenging we decided that every new song on the album must be in a different genre. 

Given a time frame of approximately 9 hours just about 1.5 hours could be spend on recording and producing each song, making it necessary to work in teams. Thus while one team was recording another team would be working on coming up with the next song. Obviously there was not much time for being critical, and hence we often just worked with the first and best idea we came up with.
