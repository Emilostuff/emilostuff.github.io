**Algoaid is a collection of useful tools for students taking an introductory course in algorithms and data structures.**
    
When I was diving into the world of algorithms and data structures in university I supplemented the theoretical parts of the course with a lot of programming, experimenting with all the exciting new concepts I encountered. When closing in on the exam I started writing tools for my self that could help me for example double-check my answers or even solve some problems completely. 

As I found these tools very useful, I believe that other students in the same situation would appreciate them as well, not just as a help for their exam but perhaps also as another way of interacting with the curriculum during the course. Hence I took some time to adapt my code to a easy to use and well-documented Python package that is now available for everyone on PyPi (The Python Package Index) and can be downloaded by running the simple command: ```pip install algoaid```.

Writing my first package to be published on PyPi was a great learning experience. Exploring how a Python package should be structured and writing the code as clean and user-friendly as possible helped my develop my Python skills significantly.
