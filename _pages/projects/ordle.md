**An implementation of Wordle in Danish that you can either play or write a bot to play for you.**

If you haven't heard about it Wordle is like Mastermind but with words, and it's a stroke of genius. As of the year 2022 the game have gained a lot of attention and daily players, me included. I quickly became interested in finding an optimal strategy to play the game, so obviously I had to write my own version of the game (in Danish to spice things up a bit) to have a go at the problem.

As shown on the image above, I ended up making a nice little environment for writing different bots to play the game that can compare the performance of different bots and so on. Now that everything around it is set up, you only have to write the intelligent (fun) part of the bot. If you have an idea for a good algorithm you should consider checking it out and giving it a try.
